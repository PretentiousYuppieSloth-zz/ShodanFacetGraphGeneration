# ShodanFacetGraphGeneration
--Generating graphs from shodan data.



###
# - By Ketil.dk 
# - 
# - I wanted to get a better understanding of the usage of a API, so shodan seemed like a great place to start.
# - ShodanFacetBarGeneration.py takes a search chriteria and generates graphs and shares a bit of data
# - You can give it common shodan search chriteria like net:x.x.x.0/24  or search for a technology like apache, synology, IIS or the like
